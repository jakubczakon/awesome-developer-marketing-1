![Awesome Developer Marketing](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/BigFoolishGull-size_restricted.gif)

A living document of (sometimes pretty unstructured and often off-on-a-tangent) hand-picked resources for marketers who're marketing to developers (B2D).

If you're in B2D or actively marketing to developers and want to join a likeminded group of people, check out the [Developer Marketing Community](https://marketingto.dev/) I'm co-building with [Jakub Czakon](https://twitter.com/jczakon/).

üöß Very much still a work in progress üöß

I also have another list of [awesome-marketing](https://github.com/ronakganatra/awesome-marketing) resources.

Back since joining ~GraphCMS~ [Hygraph](https://hygraph.com) I've been on a steep learning curve on developer marketing - figuring out how different B2D is compared to B2C/B2B. I've grown to love the developer mindset of rewarding helpful content, avoiding shady gated practices, and building engaging communities - and I've tried to catalog my resources to help others out as well. Even though I'm now at [Lano](https://lano.io), I try to stay active in speaking with companies in the API space and co-running a developer marketing community, constantly maintaining this list as and when I find interesting resources!

Want to contribute to grow/improve this? PRs welcome!
